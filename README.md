## ‚ùÑÔ∏è About
Blizzard is the supplemental mod of the Preserved mod set which aims to enhance various aspects of the Minecraft experience. Blizzard aims to add changes that affect Minecraft's server experience and social aspects.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Gameplay Modifications
**World Border Changes**
- The world border will be set to 400 upon world creation.
- The world border will gradually grow depending on the amount of players online.
  - As the world grows larger, the world border's growth speed will decrease. <br>

_This change aims to create a tighter sense of community by keeping players closer to each other. The slow growth of the world border allows for slow expansion allowing for new resources, biomes, and structures to be uncovered._

**Advancement Changes**
- Using the advancements from [_Preserved: Inferno_](https://modrinth.com/mod/preserved-inferno), players can now gain player ranks depending on how many of the advancements they have completed. <br>

_This system adds more external motivators for those who want something to grind for._

**Sunshine Grace**
- Upon joining a server for the first time, the player will be given 10 minutes of Sunshine Grace.
  - This effect prevents mobs from targeting the player when they are on the surface. <br>

_This addition aims to reduce the frustration of players who first join the server during a night period and the reduce the frustration of not being able to make any starting progress during that night cycle._

**Miscellaneous Changes**
- Only one player will need to sleep to skip the night.
- All players will obtain the **Well Rested** effect when the night is skipped.
- Mobs will not drop items unless they are killed by the player.
- Blocks destroyed by TNT will not drop items.
- Trial spawners and vaults can no longer be broken.
- Endermen will no longer pick up or place blocks.
- Players will immediately respawn after dying.
